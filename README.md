## Core Features  

### Farmer & Farm Profiling  
Capture key details like land size, location, soil type, crop, and irrigation method.  

### Conversational Interface  
Voice and text interaction in Malayalam, Hindi, and other Indian languages.  

### Activity Tracking  
Farmers log sowing, irrigation, pest sightings, or fertilizer usage in simple terms.  

### Personalised Advisory  
AI generates proactive, contextual alerts and tips, e.g.:  
- "Rain expected, avoid spraying tomorrow."  
- "Pest outbreak nearby—inspect your brinjal crop."  

### Personalized Alerts & Notifications  
Farmers receive reminders and push notifications for:  
- Crop operations (irrigation, fertiliser, harvest)  
- Government scheme deadlines  
- Weather warnings (rainfall, heatwaves, storms)  
- Market price fluctuations and trends  

### Knowledge Engine  
Uses local crop calendars, pest data, government advisories, and best practices for improved recommendations.

The system integrates multiple modules into a seamless farmer experience:  

*Flow Overview:*  
- Farmers interact via text, audio, or image inputs.  
- Inputs are processed by the RAG Pipeline (retrieval + agentic AI + LLM).  
- Specialized modules handle crop recommendations, pest detection, weather alerts, market data, and government schemes.  
- Farmers receive outputs in their local language with confidence scores, visuals, personalized alerts, and reminders.  
- Feedback loops ensure continuous learning and refinement.
